Introduction

The development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has revolutionized various industries by offering versatile applications such as surveillance, inspection, filming, and delivery. In particular, the utilization of drones in rescue operations has gained significant attention due to their ability to access remote and hazardous locations quickly and efficiently. The essay titled "Drone rescue system based on autonomous identification and wireless charging" focuses on the innovative integration of autonomous identification and wireless charging technology to enhance the endurance and efficiency of rescue drone systems.

The system at the core of this project features a self-assembled F450 quadcopter drone equipped with cutting-edge components, including a Pixhawk flight control board, a Raspberry Pi onboard computer, an Intel435i camera, a Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) module, and an integrated solar power supply panel. The software components driving the drone's functionality consist of Ubuntu18.04+, ros+mavros+px4 for precise flight control, and the OpenCV library for QR code identification, enabling autonomous landing in scenarios where power is limited.

The primary goal of this project is to address the challenge of limited battery life in traditional UAVs by establishing charging stations in disaster-prone areas. These stations facilitate autonomous landing and wireless charging, allowing the drones to operate continuously without the need for manual intervention. By leveraging renewable energy sources like solar power, the system reduces reliance on conventional power grids, ensuring a stable power supply during emergencies.

The essay is structured to explore key tasks including autonomous takeoff and landing, autonomous target identification, and the design of wireless charging systems for both the drone and the base station. By implementing advanced technologies and innovative solutions, this project aims to revolutionize rescue operations in complex and remote environments, such as maritime, desert, and forest regions. The following sections will delve into the theoretical foundations, design methodologies, and practical implications of integrating autonomous identification and wireless charging technology into rescue drone systems.
