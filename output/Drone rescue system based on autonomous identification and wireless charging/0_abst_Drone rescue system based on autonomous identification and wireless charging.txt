Abstract:

The essay titled "Drone rescue system based on autonomous identification and wireless charging" focuses on the development of a rescue drone system using autonomous identification and wireless charging technology. The system utilizes a self-assembled F450 quadcopter drone equipped with a Pixhawk flight control board, a Raspberry Pi onboard computer, an Intel435i camera, a WPT wireless charging module, and an integrated solar power supply panel. The software components include Ubuntu18.04+, ros+mavros+px4 for flight control, and the OpenCV library for QR code identification to achieve autonomous landing. The project aims to improve the drone's endurance and rescue efficiency by establishing charging stations in disaster-prone areas for autonomous landing and wireless charging. This technology is particularly suitable for complex and remote rescue scenarios such as maritime, desert, and forest environments. By integrating renewable energy sources like solar power, the system reduces dependency on traditional power grids and ensures stable power supply during emergencies. The project is divided into tasks including autonomous takeoff and landing, autonomous target identification, and wireless charging design for both the drone and the base station.
